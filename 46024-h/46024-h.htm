Science, Manila, P. I.</i>)</p>
<p class="xd21e119">Four plates</p>
<p>Beliefs as to the origin of the earth, and of the men, animals,
plants, and various topographical features found in it, seem to survive
with greater persistence than any other trait of primitive culture.
These beliefs lie at the base of nearly all religions, and the myths in
which the beliefs are preserved are the foundation of literature. The
preservation and study of origin myths is, therefore, of much
importance in the reconstruction of the history of mankind which is the
chief aim of anthropology.</p>
<p>The peoples of the Philippines have a rich and varied mythology as
yet but little explored, but which will one day command much attention.
Among the Christianized peoples of the plains the myths are preserved
chiefly as folk tales, but in the mountains their recitation and
preservation is a real and living part of the daily religious life of
the people. Very few of these myths are written; the great majority of
them are preserved by oral tradition only.</p>
<p>Until recent years, it has been believed that all ancient records
written in the syllabic alphabets which the Filipinos possessed at the
time of the Spanish conquest had been lost. It is now known, however,
that two of these alphabets are still in use, to a limited extent, by
the wild peoples of Palawan and Mindoro; and ancient manuscripts
written in the old Bisaya alphabet have been lately discovered in a
cave in the Island of Negros. Many of these Negros manuscripts are
written myths, and translations of them are shortly to be published.
The Bisaya peoples, in general, have preserved their old pagan beliefs
to a greater extent than have the other Christian Filipinos, and it is
to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>hoped that the discovery of these manuscripts will
stimulate further investigations.</p>
<p>Among the pagan mountain peoples, with which this paper will chiefly
deal, there are no written myths except those which have been recorded
by Europeans in modern times. Some of the myths are sung or chanted
only, while others are repeated in the form of stories. In nearly every
case, the repeating of the myths forms an important part of the
religious ceremonies of the people. Many different grades of culture
are represented among these mountain peoples, and we find a
correspondingly unequal development of their mythologies. All classes
are represented: <i>primitive</i>, such as the beliefs of the
Man&#864;gyans of Mindoro, the Tagbanwas of Palawan, and the Ilongots
of northern Luzon; <i>mediocre</i>, as the beliefs of the pagan tribes
of Mindanao; and <i>highly developed</i>, such as the elaborate
polytheisms of the Ifugaos, Igorots, Kalingas, and the other peoples of
the Mountain Province in Luzon.</p>
<p>Most of the myths and legends recorded here were collected by men
well acquainted with the dialect of the people from whom the myth or
legend was obtained; they are, therefore, of much greater value than if
they had been secured through interpreters.</p>
<p>I shall next discuss a few myths from each of the classes just
mentioned.</p>

<p class="first">Our knowledge of the more primitive tribes of the
Philippines is very limited and is chiefly confined to the material
culture, together with a few of the more obvious social traits. Nothing
like a complete study of any one of these tribes has ever been made. Of
the Ilongots, most of our knowledge<a class="noteref" id="xd21e154src"
href="#xd21e154" name="xd21e154src">2</a> is contained in the records
of the early Spanish missionaries of the first part of the 18th
century, at which time an extensive exploration of the Ilongot country
was made.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e157src" href="#xd21e157" name=

paper by Worcester,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e166src" href="#xd21e166"
name="xd21e166src">4</a> which deals chiefly with the material culture,
and the notes of Dr. William Jones, who was killed while studying the

the religious beliefs. Two papers, one by Worcester<a class="noteref"

Venturello,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e196src" href="#xd21e196" name=
"xd21e196src">9</a> relate to the Tagbanwas. The religion of these
people is interesting, although primitive. The general character of
their beliefs may be seen by the following quotation from
Worcester:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e204src" href="#xd21e204" name=
"xd21e204src">10</a></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">I was especially interested in their views as to a
future life. They scouted the idea of a home in the skies, urging that
it would be <i>inaccessible</i>. Their notion was that when a Tagbanua
died he entered a cave, from which a road led down into the bowels of
the earth. After passing along this road for some time, he came
suddenly into the presence of one Tali&aacute;kood, a man of gigantic
stature, who tended a fire which burned forever between two tree-trunks
without consuming them. Tali&aacute;kood inquired of the new arrival
whether he had led a good or a bad life in the world above. The answer
came, not from the individual himself, but from a <i>louse</i> on his
body.</p>
<p>I asked what would happen should the man not chance to possess any
of these interesting arthropoda, and was informed that such an
occurrence was unprecedented! The louse was the <i>witness</i>, and
would always be found, even on the body of a little dead child.</p>
<p>According to the answer of this singular arbiter, the fate of the
deceased person was decided. If he was adjudged to have been a bad man,
Tali&aacute;kood pitched him into the fire, where he was promptly and
completely burned up. If the verdict was in his favour, he was allowed
to pass on, and soon found himself in a happy place, where the crops
were always abundant and the hunting was good. A house awaited him. If
he had died before his wife, he married again, selecting a partner from
among the wives who had preceded their husbands; but if husband and
wife chanced to die at the same time, they remarried in the world
below. Every one was well off in this happy underground abode, but
those who had been wealthy on earth were less comfortable than those
who had been poor. In the course of time sickness and death again
overtook one. In fact, one died seven times in all, going ever deeper
into the earth and improving his surroundings with each successive
inward migration, without running a second risk of getting into
Tali&aacute;kood&rsquo;s fire.</p>
<p>I could not persuade the Tagbanuas to advance any theories as to the
nature or origin of the sun, moon, and stars. Clouds they called
&ldquo;the breath of the wind.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span></p>
<p>They accounted for the tide by saying that in a far-distant sea
there lived a gigantic crab: when he went into his hole the water was
forced out, and the tide rose; when he came out the water rushed in,
and the tide fell. The thing was simplicity itself.</p>
<p>I asked them why the monkey looked so much like a man. They said
because he <i>was</i> once a man, who was very lazy when he should have
been planting rice. Vexed at his indolence, a companion threw a stick
at him which stuck into him; whereupon he assumed his present form, the
stick forming his tail.</p>
</div>
<p>From the foregoing, it is evident that the Tagbanwa beliefs are not
highly developed. However, several items are of interest for comparison
with the beliefs of the more cultured tribes to be later described. Of
these items, those most to be kept in mind are the idea of a
seven-storied underworld, and the name of the chief deity of that
underworld, Tali&aacute;kud. This name comes from the stem
<i>t&aacute;kud</i>, <i>t&uacute;kud</i>, or <i>t&oacute;kod</i>, which
is common to many Philippine dialects and means &ldquo;post&rdquo; or
&ldquo;support.&rdquo; It is generally applied to the four legs or
posts of the common Philippine house. Now, the belief in an Atlas, or
god who supports the earth world, is widespread in the Philippines, and
the name applied to this god is nearly always derived from this same
stem <i>t&uacute;kud</i>. The Ifugao Atlas is Tin&uacute;kud of the
underworld, and I suspect that the Tagbanwa Tali&aacute;kud of the
underworld is a deity of the same character.</p>

<h3 class="main">Beliefs of the Pagan Tribes of Mindanao</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The interior of Mindanao is occupied by some ten pagan
tribes, the most important being the Man&oacute;bos, Mandayas,
At&aacute;s, Bag&oacute;bos, Bil&aacute;ns, Tirurais, and
Sub&aacute;nuns. These tribes are all remarkably alike in culture; much
more so, in fact, than any other similar group of peoples in the
Philippines; and this culture shows a close resemblance to that of the
tribes in the interior of Borneo. In the development of their myths and
of their religious beliefs, these peoples occupy a middle position
between the more primitive and the highest developed types of the
Philippines. John M. Garvan has recently completed a very extensive
study of the Man&oacute;bo peoples of the <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e256" title="Source: Agusan">Ag&uacute;san</span> Valley, in
eastern Mindanao, and the following beliefs and myths are quoted from
his unpublished notes.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 story">
<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Origin of the Earth and its Inhabitants</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The story of the creation of the world is variable
throughout the whole Ag&uacute;san Valley. In the district surrounding
Talak&oacute;gon, the creation is attributed to
<i>Makal&iacute;dun&#864;g</i>, the first great Man&oacute;bo. The
details of his great work are very meager. He set it up on posts (some
say iron posts) with one in the center. At the central post he has his
abode, in company with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89"
name="pb89">89</a>]</span>a python, according to the version of some,
and whenever he feels displeasure toward men, he shakes the post,
thereby producing an earthquake, and at the same time intimating to man
his anger. It is believed that, should the trembling continue, the
world would be destroyed.</p>
<p>In the same district it is believed that the sky is round and that
its extremities are at the limits of the sea. Somewhat near these
limits is an enormous hole called <i>the navel of the sea</i> through
which the waters descend.</p>
<p>It is said that in the early days of creation the sky was low, but
that one day a woman, while pounding rice, hit it with her pestle and
it ascended to its present position.</p>
<p>Another version of the creation, prevalent among the Man&oacute;bos
of the Argauan and H&iacute;bun&#864;g Rivers, gives the control of the
world to <i>D&aacute;gau</i>, who lives at the four fundamental pillars
in the company of a python. Being a woman, D&aacute;gau dislikes the
sight of human blood, and when it is spilled upon the face of the earth
she incites the huge serpent to wreathe itself around the pillars and
shake the world to its foundations. Should she become exceedingly
angry, she diminishes the supply of rice either by removing it from the
granary or by making the soil unproductive.</p>
<p>Another variation of the story to be heard on the Upper
Ag&uacute;san, Simulau, and Umayan Rivers, has it that the world is
like a huge mushroom and that it is supported upon an iron pillar in
the center. This pillar is controlled by the higher and more powerful
order of <i>diuw&aacute;ta</i>, who on becoming angered at the actions
of men manifest their feelings by shaking the pillar and thereby
reminding men of their duties.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Three points in the beliefs just mentioned should be kept in mind.
<i>First</i>, the recurrence of the idea that the earth world is
supported by a post created by the chief deity and near which he
dwells. <i>Second</i>, the belief in the <i>p&uacute;sod nan&#864;g
d&aacute;gat</i>, or &ldquo;navel of the sea,&rdquo; which is common to
all of the pagan tribes of Mindanao and was also known by the ancient
Bis&aacute;yas, Tag&aacute;logs, and other peoples now Christianized.
It is extremely probable that this belief originated from some great
whirlpool, known to the ancestors of the Philippine peoples or passed
by them on their voyages.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e301src" href=
"#xd21e301" name="xd21e301src">11</a> <i>Third</i>, the belief that the
sky was once very near the earth, and was raised to its present
position by some deity. This belief is also common in northern
Luzon.</p>
<p>The idea of the origin of curious-shaped rocks, hills, or mountains
by petrifaction of some living animal or plant is common in the
Philippines. Garvan gives the two following Man&oacute;bo legends of
this character:</p>

K&aacute;gbub&aacute;tan&#864;g</h2>

<p class="first">In the old, old days a boat was passing the rocky
promontory of K&aacute;gbub&aacute;tan&#864;g.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e317src" href="#xd21e317" name="xd21e317src">12</a> The occupants
espied a monkey and a cat fighting upon the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>summit
of the cliff. The incongruity of the thing suggested itself to them,
and they began to give vent to derisive remarks, addressing themselves
to the brute combatants, when, lo and behold! they and their craft were
turned into rock. To this day the petrified craft and crew may be seen
placed upon the promontory, and all who pass must make an
offering,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e322src" href="#xd21e322" name=

and rough seas.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e325src" href="#xd21e325"
name="xd21e325src">14</a></p>
<p>The imitation of frogs is especially forbidden, for it might be
followed not merely by thunderbolts but also by petrifaction of the
offender, and in proof of this is adduced the legend of

<h2 class="main">The Legend of An&#864;g&oacute;, the Petrified
Man&oacute;bo</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">An&#864;g&oacute; lived many years ago on a lofty peak
with his wife and family. One day he hied him to the forest with his
dogs in quest of game. Fortune granted him a fine big boar, but he
broke his spear in dealing the mortal blow. Upon arriving at a stream,
he sat down upon a stone and set himself to straightening out his
spear. The croaking of the nearby frogs attracted his attention, and,
imitating their shrill gamut, he boldly told them that it would be
better to cease their cries and help him mend his spear. He continued
his course up the rocky torrent, but noticed that a multitude of little
stones began to follow behind in his path. Surprised at such a
happening, he hastened his steps. Looking back he saw bigger stones
join in the pursuit. He then seized his dog, and in fear began to run,
but the stones kept in hot pursuit, bigger and bigger ones joining the
party. Upon arriving at his sweet-potato patch, he was exhausted and
had to slacken his pace, whereupon the stones overtook him and one
became attached to his finger. He could not go on. He called upon his
wife. She with the young ones sought the magic lime<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e347src" href="#xd21e347" name="xd21e347src">16</a> and set it
around her husband, but all to no avail for his feet began to turn to
stone. His wife and children, too, fell under the wrath of
<i>An&iacute;tan</i>. The following morning they were stone up to the
knees, and during the following three days the petrifying continued
from the knees to the hips, then to the breast, and then to the head.
Thus it is that to this day there may be seen on Bin&aacute;oi peak the
petrified forms of An&#864;g&oacute; and his family.<a class="noteref"

<p>The sun, moon, and stars are great deities, or the dwelling place of
such deities, in nearly all Philippine religions. The following
Man&oacute;bo myth is interesting because of its resemblance to others
from northern Luzon. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91"

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">The Origin of the Stars and the Explanation of Sunset
and Sunrise</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is said that in the olden time the Sun and the Moon
were married. They led a peaceful, harmonious life. Two children were
the issue of their wedlock. One day the Moon had to attend to one of
the household duties that fall to the lot of a woman, some say to get
water, others say to get the daily supply of food from the fields.
Before departing, she crooned the children to sleep and told her
husband to watch them but not to approach lest by the heat that
radiated from his body he might harm them. She then started upon her
errand. The Sun, who never before had been allowed to touch his bairns,
arose and approached their sleeping place. He gazed upon them fondly,
and, bending down, kissed them, but the intense heat that issued from
his countenance melted them like wax. Upon perceiving this he wept and
quietly betook himself to the adjoining forest in great fear of his
wife.</p>
<p>The Moon returned duly, and after depositing her burden in the house
turned to where the children slept but found only their dried,
inanimate forms. She broke out into a loud wail, and in the wildness of
her grief called upon her husband. But he gave no answer. Finally
softened by the loud long plaints, he returned to his house. At the
sight of him the wild cries of grief and of despair and of rebuke
redoubled themselves until finally the husband, unable to soothe the
wife, became angry and called her his chattel. At first she feared his
anger and quieted her sobs, but, finally breaking out into one long
wail, she seized the burnt forms of her babes, and in the depth of her
anguish and her rage threw them to the ground in different directions.
Then the husband became angry again, and, seizing some taro leaves that
his wife had brought from the fields, cast them in her face and went
his way. Upon his return he could not find his wife, and so it is to
this day that the Sun follows the Moon in an eternal cycle of night and
day. And so it is, too, that stars stand scattered in the sable
firmament, for they, too, accompany her in her hasty flight. Ever and
anon a shooting star breaks across her path, but that is only a
messenger from her husband to call her back. She, however, heeds it
not, but speeds on her way in never-ending flight with the marks of the
taro leaves<a class="noteref" id="xd21e372src" href="#xd21e372" name=
"xd21e372src">18</a> still upon her face and her starry train
accompanying her to the dawn and on to the sunset in one eternal
flight.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>On myths such as these the religions of the pagan tribes of Mindanao
are built up. These religions are by no means primitive, but are
accompanied by sacrifices, sometimes human, and the ceremonies are
performed by a well-developed priest class.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Let us now turn to the highest type of Philippine beliefs:</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Well-developed Polytheistic Religions of Northern
Luzon</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I shall mention chiefly the Igorot, Bontok, and Ifugao
peoples, as these three, in addition to holding the highest order of
beliefs, are the best developed in general material and social culture
of any of the Philippine mountain tribes. The Tin&#864;ggi&aacute;n,
Kalinga, and other tribes in that region also have religions of high
type, but our information concerning them is more limited.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e395src" href="#xd21e395" name=
"xd21e395src">20</a></p>
<p>The literature relating to the Igorot-Bontok-Ifugao group is very
considerable in extent, and I shall refer only to a few of the more
important papers dealing particularly with religion and mythology.</p>
<p>Before taking up the mythology proper, we should have some idea of
the religion as a whole. These peoples believe that the regions of the
sky world, earth world, and underworld are peopled by an almost
incalculable number of deities of varying character and powers. Some of
these deities are the great beings who inspire the phenomena of nature,
while others are guardian spirits, messenger spirits, or mischievous
tricksters. The great nature deities are mostly of malevolent
character, and are much feared. Ancestral souls and the souls of sacred
animals are looked upon as mediators between gods and men. Pigs and
chickens are sacrificed to the deities, and other articles of food and
drink are provided for them. Many elaborate religious feasts and
ceremonies are held at which priests officiate. The priests form a
well-defined class, and in some districts there are also priestesses. A
religious ceremony is required for every important act of life, and the
priests and priestesses are usually busy people.</p>
<p>It would seem that a religion of this same general type was also
common among the lowland peoples of the Philippines before they were
Christianized by the Spaniards. Pigafetta, the first European to write
of the Philippines, describes a ceremony, which he saw performed in
Cebu in the year 1520, as follows:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e404src"
href="#xd21e404" name="xd21e404src">21</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">In order that your most illustrious Lordship may know
the ceremonies that those people use in consecrating the swine, they
first sound those large gongs. Then three large dishes are brought in;
two with roses and with cakes of rice and millet, baked and wrapped in
leaves, and roast fish; the other with cloth of Cambaia and two
standards made of palm-tree cloth. One bit of cloth of Cambaia is
spread on the ground. Then two very old women come, each of whom has a
bamboo trumpet in her hand. When they have stepped upon the cloth they
make obeisance to the sun. Then they wrap the cloths about themselves.
One of them puts a kerchief with two horns on her forehead, and takes
another kerchief in her hands, and dancing and blowing upon her
trumpet, she thereby calls out to the sun. The other takes one of the
standards and dances and blows on her trumpet. They dance and call out
thus for a little space, saying many things between themselves to the
sun. She with the kerchief takes the other standard, and lets the
kerchief drop, and both blowing on their trumpets for a long time,
dance about the bound hog. She with the horns always speaks covertly to
the sun, and the other answers her. A cup of wine is presented to her
of the horns, and she dancing and repeating certain words, while the
other answers her, and making pretense four or five times of drinking
the wine, sprinkles it upon the heart of the hog. Then she immediately
begins to dance again. A lance is given to the same woman. She shaking
it and repeating certain words, while both of them continue to dance,
and making motions four or five times of thrusting the lance through
the heart of the hog, with a sudden and quick stroke, thrusts it
through from one side to the other. The wound is quickly stopped with
grass. The one who has killed the hog, taking in her mouth a lighted
torch, which has been lighted throughout that ceremony, extinguishes
it. The other one dipping the end of her trumpet in the blood of the
hog, goes around marking with blood with her finger first the foreheads
of their husbands, and then the others; but they never came to us. Then
they divest themselves and go to eat the contents of those dishes, and
they invite only women (to eat with them). The hair is removed from the
hog by means of fire. Thus no one but old women consecrate the flesh of
the hog, and they do not eat it unless it is killed in this way.</p>
</div>
<p>This ceremony, almost the same as described by Pigafetta, is in use
among the Ifugaos to-day, although it is performed by men instead of by
women and differs in a few minor details.</p>
<p>I shall next discuss the religion and mythology of the Igorots,
Bontoks, and Ifugaos, treated separately and in more detail.</p>

<div id="xd21e416" class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Igorots</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">These people occupy the subprovinces of Benguet,
Lepanto, and Amburayan in the Mountain Province. The region of their
purest culture is in northern Benguet and eastern Lepanto. Of the
religion of this region, we have considerable information from the
writings of Fr. Angel Perez, an Augustinian missionary; Sr. Sinforoso
Bondad of Cervantes, Lepanto; and a number of personal observations
made by myself. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p>The sun gods, and the deities of the sky world in general, occupy
the most important place in the Igorot religion. Place-spirits and
animal deities are likewise highly developed. At a place called
K&aacute;gub&aacute;tan,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e424src" href=
"#xd21e424" name="xd21e424src">22</a> at the foot of the sacred
mountain M&uacute;gao in eastern Lepanto, is a small lake full of
sacred eels which the people guard with great care. They believe that
if these eels were killed the springs would all dry up and they would
have no water for their terraced rice fields. The eels are fed every
day with rice and sweet potatoes by the children of the village, who,
as they approach the lakelet, sing a peculiarly sweet and mournful
song, upon hearing which the eels all rise to the surface of the water
and approach the shore to receive their food.</p>
<p>The Igorots have both priests and priestesses, and they perform many
public and private ceremonies, both for the benefit of the great
deities and for the countless minor spirits which inhabit the sacred
mountains, cliffs, groves, trees, and bushes that are scattered
throughout the Igorot country. Sacrifices of pigs or chickens are made
at every ceremony. The ceremonies of the common people are more or less
of a private nature, but those of the aristocracy and of wealthy men
are nearly always public and general. The greatest ceremonies are those
connected with war and marriage and the great public festival which
proves a man&rsquo;s right to the title of nobility.</p>
<p>The Igorots have a high code of morals which is closely associated
with their religious belief. They also have a scientific calendar and a
considerable knowledge of astronomy which has effected many
modifications in their religion. Their mythology is extensive, and they
have a rich unwritten literature of epic poems, hero-stories, and
historical legends. Most of the myths are too long to be given here,
but for purposes of comparison I give the following short one which was
collected by the Dominican, Fr. Mariano Rodriguez:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">It has been mentioned above that among their tales and
stories they preserve a tradition relating to their origin and
beginning, after a great and dreadful flood which, a very long time
ago, as their old people relate, covered the earth. All the inhabitants
except a brother and sister were drowned. The brother and sister,
though separated from each other, were saved, the woman on the summit
of the highest mountain in the District of Lepanto, called
Kalau&iacute;tan, and the man in a cave of the same mountain.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>After the water had subsided, the man of the cave
came out from his hiding place one clear and calm moonlight night, and
as he glanced around that immense solitude, his eyes were struck by the
brightness of a big bonfire burning there on the summit of the
mountain. Surprised and terrified, he did not venture to go up on the
summit where the fire was, but returned to his cave. At the dawn of day
he quickly climbed toward the place where he had seen the brightness
the preceding night, and there he found huddled up on the highest peak
his sister, who received him with open arms. They say that from this
brother and sister so providentially saved, all the Igorots that are
scattered through the mountains originated. They are absolutely
ignorant of the names of those privileged beings, but the memory of
them lives freshly among the Igorots, and in their feasts, or whenever
they celebrate their marriages, the aged people repeat to the younger
ones this wonderful history, so that they can tell it to their sons,
and in that way pass from generation to generation the memory of their
first progenitors.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e436src" href="#xd21e436"
name="xd21e436src">23</a></p>
</div>
<p>This myth of the great flood, and of the brother and sister who
survived it, is common throughout northern Luzon. It is most highly
developed by the Ifugaos, as we shall later see.</p>

<p class="first">The Bontoks are sometimes wrongly called Igorots, but
have no more right to that name than have the Ifugaos. They are a
distinct people, occupying a part of the subprovince of Bontok. They
are in some respects unique, and possess certain social institutions
and traits which have not been found elsewhere in the Philippines. Most
of our information concerning them is contained in the monograph by

<h4 class="main">Stories about Lum&aacute;wig</h4>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">The sons of Lum&aacute;wig went hunting. In all the
world there were no mountains, for the world was flat, and it was
impossible to catch the wild pigs and the deer. Then said the elder
brother: &ldquo;Let us flood the world so that mountains may rise
up.&rdquo; Then they went to inundate at Mab&uacute;d-bod&oacute;bud.
Then the world was flooded. Then said the elder brother: &ldquo;Let us
go and set a trap.&rdquo; They used as a trap the head-basket at
Mab&uacute;d-bod&oacute;bud. Then they raised the head-basket and there
was much booty: wild pigs and deer and people&mdash;for all the people
had perished. There were alive only a brother and sister on Mt.
P&oacute;kis. Then Lum&aacute;wig looked down on P&oacute;kis and saw
that it was the only place not reached by the water, and that it was
the abode of the solitary brother and sister. Then Lum&aacute;wig
descended and said: &ldquo;Oh, you are here!&rdquo; And the man said:
&ldquo;We are here, and here we freeze!&rdquo; Then Lum&aacute;wig sent
his dog and his deer to Kalauw&iacute;tan to get fire. They swam to
Kalauw&iacute;tan, the dog and the deer, and they got the fire.
Lum&aacute;wig awaited them. He said: &ldquo;How long they are
coming!&rdquo; Then he went to Kalauw&iacute;tan and said to his dog
and the deer: &ldquo;Why do you delay in bringing the fire? Get ready!
Take the fire to P&oacute;kis; let me watch you!&rdquo; Then they went
into the middle of the flood, and the fire which they had brought from
Kalauw&iacute;tan was put out! Then said Lum&aacute;wig: <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e470" title="Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Why do you
delay the taking? Again you must bring fire; let me watch you!&rdquo;
Then they brought fire again, and he observed that that which the deer
was carrying was extinguished, and he said: &ldquo;That which the dog
has yonder will surely also be extinguished.&rdquo; Then Lum&aacute;wig
swam and arrived and quickly took the fire which his dog had brought.
He took it back to P&oacute;kis and he built a fire and warmed the
brother and sister. Then said Lum&aacute;wig: &ldquo;You must marry,
you brother and sister!&rdquo; Then said the woman: &ldquo;That is
possible; but it is abominable, because we are brother and
sister!&rdquo; Then Lum&aacute;wig united them, and the woman became
pregnant. They had many children * * * and Lum&aacute;wig continued
marrying them. Two went to Maligkon&#864;g and had offspring there; two
went to Gin&aacute;an&#864;g and had offspring there; and the people
kept multiplying, and they are the inhabitants of the earth * * *.
Moreover, there are the Mayinit-men, the Baliwan&#864;g-men, the
Tuk&uacute;kan-men, the Kani&uacute;-men, the Barlig-men, etc. Thus the
world is distributed among the people, and the people are very many! *
* *</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Another story runs as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">The brother-in-law of Lum&aacute;wig said to him:
&ldquo;Create water, because the sun is very hot, and all the people
are thirsty!&rdquo; Then said Lum&aacute;wig: &ldquo;Why do you ask so
much for water? Let us go on,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I shall soon
create water.&rdquo; Then they went on, and at last his brother-in-law
said again: &ldquo;Well, why do you not create water? It should be
easy, if you are really Lum&aacute;wig!&rdquo; Then said
Lum&aacute;wig: &ldquo;Why do you shame me in public?&rdquo; And then
they quarreled, the brothers-in-law. Then they climbed on up the
mountain, and at last the brother-in-law said <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>again:
&ldquo;Why do you care nothing because the people are thirsty, and you
do not create water?&rdquo; Then said Lum&aacute;wig: &ldquo;Let us sit
down, people, and rest.&rdquo; Then he struck the rock with his spear,
and water sprang out. Then he said to the people: &ldquo;Come and
drink!&rdquo; And his brother-in-law stepped forth to drink, but
Lum&aacute;wig restrained him, saying: &ldquo;Do not drink! Let the
people drink first, so that we shall be the last to drink.&rdquo; And
when the people had finished drinking, Lum&aacute;wig drank. Then he
said to his brother-in-law: &ldquo;Come and drink.&rdquo; Then the
brother-in-law stooped to drink, and Lum&aacute;wig pushed him into the
rock. Water gushed out from his body. Then said Lum&aacute;wig:
&ldquo;Stay thou here because of thy annoying me!&rdquo; Then they
named that spot <i>ad Isik</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e483src"
href="#xd21e483" name="xd21e483src">27</a> Then the people went home;
and the sister of Lum&aacute;wig said to him: &ldquo;Why did you push
your brother-in-law into the rock?&rdquo; Then said Lum&aacute;wig:
&ldquo;Surely, because he angered me!&rdquo; Then the people prayed and
performed sacrifices. * * *</p>
</div>
<p>In the above stories we see the recurrence of the flood myth and the
origin of fire, or rather the manner in which men received it. The
story of bringing water out of a rock is interesting, and occurs again
in Ifugao mythology in a slightly different form. It is possible, of
course, that this is a biblical story which was brought in by some
wandering Christians several generations past; but the flood legend is
certainly native, and I see no good reason why the story of the
miraculous drawing of water from a rock should not also be a native
development in spite of its similarity to the Hebrew myth.</p>
<p>The Bontoks have hundreds of myths and stories about Lum&aacute;wig,
who corresponds to the Ifugao L&iacute;ddum, who is the good god who
gave men fire, animals, plants, and all the useful and necessary
articles of daily life. These myths are of great value, and it is to be
hoped that a full collection of them will some day be made.</p>
<p>The Bontok religion is, on the whole, somewhat less developed than
that of the Igorots and Ifugaos. The same general beliefs are held,
however, and the ceremonial life is similar. Priests are the rule,
rather than priestesses; and the same sacred animals are used, as in
the other areas. In the social organization, the clan system is in a
more perfect state of development than among any other people in the
Philippines.</p>
<p>I shall now take up the last religion to be discussed, and the one
which is at the same time the most highly developed: <span class=

Ifugaos</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Ifugao conception of the universe differs
considerably in the different religious districts.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e516src" href="#xd21e516" name="xd21e516src">30</a> The Western
Ifugao and Central Ifugao beliefs are closely associated, but stand
quite apart from those of Ki&aacute;n&#864;gan Ifugao. The people of
the latter area think of the universe as being composed of a large
number of horizontal layers which are very similar one to the other.
The upper face of each of these layers is of earth, while the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>lower face of each of them is of a smooth blue
stone called <i>m&uacute;lin&#864;g</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e527src" href="#xd21e527" name="xd21e527src">31</a> The layer on
which we live is called the Earth World (L&uacute;ta). The four layers
above us constitute the Sky World (D&aacute;ya), and are called, in
order from the top down, H&uacute;dog, Lukt&aacute;g, Hubul&aacute;n,
and Kab&uacute;nian. The last is the layer immediately above the Earth
World, and it is the blue-stone underfacing of this layer that we call
the &ldquo;sky.&rdquo; The Under World (D&aacute;lom) consists of an
unknown number of layers beneath the one on which we live. All of the
layers meet in the farthest horizon,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e533src"
href="#xd21e533" name="xd21e533src">32</a> where lie the mythical
regions of the East (L&aacute;gud) and other places.</p>
<p>Some of the Ki&aacute;n&#864;gan priests seem to have developed the
further idea that this D&aacute;wi, or farthest horizon, is in the form
of a great celestial globe that surrounds the universe, forming its
boundary, the inside face of which can be distinguished in the hazy
distance where the deep blue of the sky fades into a very light blue or
whitish color.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e538src" href="#xd21e538"
name="xd21e538src">33</a> The Earth World, or layer on which we live,
lies approximately at the center of the universe. It is therefore the
largest layer, and the layers of the Sky World and Under World grow
successively smaller as they approach the zenith and nadir of the
celestial globe, the boundary of the universe.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e541src" href="#xd21e541" name="xd21e541src">34</a></p>
<p>The inhabitants of the universe consist chiefly of an incalculable
number of greater and lesser deities and spirits.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e549src" href="#xd21e549" name="xd21e549src">35</a> In addition to
these, there are the souls of men, animals, and plants. <span class=

have always existed in the various regions of the universe, and were
brought to the Earth World by the gods. Men are descended from the gods
of the Sky World, as we shall see in the myths.</p>

<p class="first"><i>Origin of the mountains.</i>&mdash;The first son of
W&iacute;gan, called Kabig&aacute;t, went from the sky region
H&uacute;dog to the Earth World to hunt with dogs. As the earth was
then entirely level, his dogs ran much from one side to another,
pursuing the quarry, and this they did without Kabig&aacute;t hearing
their barking. In consequence of which, it is reported that
Kabig&aacute;t said: &ldquo;I see that the earth is completely flat,
because there does not resound the echo of the barking of the
dogs.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e574src" href="#xd21e574" name=
"xd21e574src">37</a>&rdquo; After becoming pensive for a little while,
he decided to return to the heights of the Sky World. Later on he came
down again with a very large cloth, and went to close the exit to the
sea of the waters of the rivers, and so it remained closed. He returned
again to H&uacute;dog, and went to make known to
Bon&#864;g&aacute;bon&#864;g that he had closed the outlet of the
waters. Bon&#864;g&aacute;bon&#864;g answered him: &ldquo;Go thou to
the house of the Cloud, and of the Fog, and bring them to me.&rdquo;
For this purpose he had given permission beforehand to Cloud and Fog,
intimating to them that they should go to the house of
Baiyuh&iacute;bi,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e577src" href="#xd21e577"
name="xd21e577src">38</a> and so they did. Baiyuh&iacute;bi brought
together his sons Tumiok, Dumal&aacute;lu, Lum-&uacute;dul,
Mumbat&aacute;nol, and Inapl&iacute;han, and he bade them to rain
without ceasing for three days. Then Bon&#864;g&aacute;bon&#864;g
called to X ... and to Man&#864;giu&aacute;lat, and so they ceased.
W&iacute;gan said, moreover, to his son Kabig&aacute;t: &ldquo;Go thou
and remove the stopper that thou hast placed on the waters,&rdquo; and
so he did. And in this manner, when the waters that had covered the
earth began to recede, there rose up mountains and valleys, formed by
the rushing of the waters.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e580src" href=
"#xd21e580" name="xd21e580src">39</a> Then Bon&#864;g&aacute;bon&#864;g
called Mumb&aacute;&rsquo;an that he might dry the earth, and so he
did.</p>

<p class="first"><i>The first inhabitants of the Earth
World.</i>&mdash;Such being the state of affairs, Kabig&aacute;t went
to hunt once again; and, while following the dogs, that were chasing a
quarry, he made a thrust with his spear into a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>spring (or fountain) at the foot of a large
tree. Immediately Kabig&aacute;t returned to H&uacute;dog, bringing
with him the captured quarry. When he had dressed and eaten the savory
game, Kabig&aacute;t said to his father W&iacute;gan that he had seen
on the Earth World a spring and very good and beautiful trees for
timber with which to make houses, and that accordingly he was desirous
of going down to live at such a delightful place. His father answered
him that if he so desired he might do so.</p>
<p>Some time after Kabig&aacute;t had departed, and after he had cut
excellent timber wherewith to build a house, W&iacute;gan said to his
daughter B&uacute;gan: &ldquo;Look, daughter! Thy brother
Kabig&aacute;t is down in Kai-&aacute;n&#864;g building a house. I
think that it would behoove thee to look after his meals.&rdquo;
B&uacute;gan volunteered to descend with such a design. This intention
having been carried out, she lodged herself in the upper part of the
house, and her brother dwelt in the lower part.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Kabig&aacute;t, reflecting on his solitude and want
of company, and, seeing that the domestic chickens, even though related
among themselves, produced other roosters and hens, resolved to know
carnally his sister B&uacute;gan, during her sleep. Some time having
expired, the sister noted that she had fruit in her womb. * * * Such
was the sadness and melancholy that came upon her, that she did nothing
else but to weep and bewail herself, and to seek by some means
alleviation for her sorrow through a violent death. She pretended to
her brother that she was going to look for <i>&iacute;sda</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e599src" href="#xd21e599" name="xd21e599src">40</a>
but what she did was to follow the course of the river until she
arrived at its mouth in L&aacute;gud (the Eastern World). Upon arriving
at the shore of the sea, she remained there weeping and waiting for
someone to take away her life in a violent way. Soon her brother
Kabig&aacute;t (who had followed her) appeared there, and B&uacute;gan,
upon discerning him, cast herself into the depths; but, instead of
going to the bottom, she stopped at the rice granary of
N&#864;g&iacute;l&icirc;n Man&#864;g&oacute;n&#864;gol. The brother,
who witnessed the tragedy, did not stop at trifles but at once cast
himself after her into the depths of the ocean, stopping, by a strange
coincidence, at the very same rice granary as his fugitive sister and
spouse. She continued there, bemoaning her misfortune, when, behold!
N&#864;g&iacute;l&icirc;n, hearing her plaint, approached and inquired
the cause of her affliction. She related to him her trouble, how she
had conceived by her carnal brother when she was asleep.
N&#864;g&iacute;l&icirc;n soothed her as follows: &ldquo;Do not be
afflicted, daughter, by that. Are not the fowls of Kai-&aacute;n&#864;g
related among themselves, and yet they beget just like those that are
not so?&rdquo; The maiden became somewhat calm, but still, out of shame
for what had happened, she refused to eat what
N&#864;g&iacute;l&icirc;n offered her. Then he said to her: &ldquo;In
order that thou mayst further assure thyself of what I tell thee, and
in order that thou mayst quiet thyself, let us go and consult my elder
brother Amb&uacute;mabb&aacute;kal.&rdquo; And so they did.
Amb&uacute;mabb&aacute;kal, having been informed of the circumstances,
burst out laughing and said to them: &ldquo;Peradventure have ye not
done well and righteously, there not being in existence any others but
yourselves to procreate? However, for greater assurance, let us all go
together to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=

father.&rdquo; Munt&aacute;log, having heard their story, applauded the
conduct of the solitary brother and sister. He told them, accordingly,
to calm themselves and to rest there for a few days,&mdash;and so they
did.</p>

in my turn go to my father Mumb&oacute;nan&#864;g.&rdquo;
Munt&aacute;log found his father and mother seated facing each other;
and, upon his arrival, his mother, Mumboniag, came forward and asked
him: &ldquo;What news do you bring from those lower regions, and why do
you come?&rdquo; The father also became aware of the presence of his
son, through the questioning of the mother, and inquired likewise as to
the reason of his coming. Munt&aacute;log answered: &ldquo;I have come,
father, to ask thee for fire for some Ifugaos who remain in the house
of Amb&uacute;mabb&aacute;kal.&rdquo; &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; the father
replied, &ldquo;those Ifugaos of yours could not arrive at (or, come

those bristles that stand out from my hair,&rdquo; and so
Munt&aacute;log did, noticing that the said point faced the north, and
he placed it in his hand. Then Mumb&oacute;nan&#864;g said to him
again: &ldquo;Come nigh! Take this white part, or extremity, of the eye
that looks toward the northeast, toward the place called
Gonh&aacute;dan.&rdquo; And he took it and placed it in his hand. And
Mumb&oacute;nan&#864;g said to him once more: &ldquo;Come near again,
and take the part black as coal, the dirt of my ear which is as the
foulness of my ear.&rdquo; And so he did. Then Mumb&oacute;nan&#864;g
said to Munt&aacute;log: &ldquo;Take these things and bring them to thy
son Amb&uacute;mabb&aacute;kal and to N&#864;g&iacute;l&icirc;n, in
order that the latter may give them to the Ifugaos.&rdquo; And he said
again to Munt&aacute;log: &ldquo;Take this white of my eye (flint),
this wax from my ear (tinder), and this bristle or point like steel for
striking fire, in order that thou mayst have the wherewith to attain
what thou seekest (that is, <i>fire</i>), and to give gradually from
hand to hand to the Ifugao; and tell him not to return to live in
Kai-&aacute;n&#864;g, but to live in Otb&oacute;bon, and cut down the
trees and make a clearing there, and then to get together dry grass;
and that they make use of the steel for striking fire, holding it
together in this manner, and burying it in the grass. And on making the
clearing if they see that snakes, owls, or other things of evil omen
approach, it is a sign that they are going to die or to have
misfortunes. But if they do not approach them, it is a sign that it
will go well with them in that place; that the soil will be productive,
and that they will be happy.&rdquo;</p>

Later they constructed a good house, and it was just after it was
finished that B&uacute;gan gave birth to a healthy boy; and the fowls
also procreated.</p>
<p>The child grew a little, but there came to him an unlooked-for
sickness. Then Kabig&aacute;t remembered that
Amb&uacute;mabb&aacute;kal had advised them to offer fowls to their
ancestors in case any sickness should come upon them. So they killed a
rooster and a hen, and offered them to Amp&uacute;al, Wigan, and their
other ancestors. The child recovered and began to grow very robust and
plump. They named him Balit&uacute;k. B&uacute;gan conceived again, and
she gave birth to a strong girl, to whom she gave the name of
Lin&#864;gan. These children grew up, and, having attained a
marriageable age, were married like their parents, and gave origin to
the Silipanes.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e660src" href="#xd21e660"

<p>Their parents, Kabig&aacute;t and B&uacute;gan, had a second son, on

whom they called In&uacute;ke. She and Tad-&oacute;na did what their
parents and brother and sister had done, and gave birth to
Kabig&aacute;t, the second, and B&uacute;gan, the second. These latter
two, imitating the preceding ones, were united in wedlock and begot

<p>Some version of the above myth is known to the people of every
Ifugao clan, although the details of the story vary considerably in the
different culture areas. The myth is also known to the Igorots and
Bontoks, as we have already seen. I have in my possession some twenty
different versions that have been collected from various clans of
Central, Western, and Ki&aacute;n&#864;gan Ifugao. These may all be
classified into two general types, one of which is represented
above.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e697src" href="#xd21e697" name=
"xd21e697src">48</a> An example of the other type, entitled The Ifugao
Flood-Myth, is given later in this paper under the heading Central
Ifugao Beliefs.</p>
<p>The god W&iacute;gan is one of the greatest and best known figures
in Ifugao mythology. He has three sons, Kabig&aacute;t, Balit&uacute;k,
and Ih&icirc;k, and one daughter, B&uacute;gan. The following story
about Ih&icirc;k is especially interesting because of its resemblance
to one of the Bontok myths previously given.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Ih&icirc;k nak W&iacute;gan, in company with his
brothers Kabig&aacute;t and Balit&uacute;k, went to catch fish in the
canal called Amk&iacute;dul at the base of Mt. In&uacute;de. After
catching a supply of fish, they strove to ascend to the summit of the
mountain; but, ever as they went up, Ih&icirc;k kept asking his
brothers for water to satiate his devouring thirst. They answered him:
&ldquo;How can we find water at such an elevation? Water is found at
the base of the mountains but not at their summits!&rdquo; But
Ih&icirc;k kept on importuning them. At last, when they were in the
middle of their ascent, they came to an enormous rock. Balit&uacute;k
struck the rock with his spear, and instantly there burst forth a large
jet of water.</p>
<p>Ih&icirc;k desired to drink first but they deterred him, saying:
&ldquo;It is not just that thou shouldst drink first, being the last
born of us brothers!&rdquo; Then Kabig&aacute;t drank, and afterwards
Balit&uacute;k. Just as Ih&icirc;k was about to do so, Balit&uacute;k
seized him and shoved the whole of his head under the rock, adding:
&ldquo;Drink! Satiate thyself once for all, and serve henceforth as a
tube for others to drink from!&rdquo; And so it came to pass that
Ih&icirc;k on receiving the water through his mouth sent it forth at
the base of his trunk. He said to his brothers: &ldquo;You are bent on
making me take the part of a water-spout! I shall do so, but bear in
mind that I shall <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105"
name="pb105">105</a>]</span>also take just vengeance on your
descendants for this injury.&rdquo; In view of this threat,
Kabig&aacute;t and Balit&uacute;k did not dare to make use of the
improvised fountain, and so they returned home.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This myth, which is very long, then relates how certain of the great
deities befriended Ih&icirc;k by setting him free and assisting him in
obtaining vengeance on his brothers and their descendants.</p>
<p>Another myth, showing an interesting resemblance to a Man&oacute;bo
myth already given, tells how the sky region of
Manah&aacute;ut,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e723src" href="#xd21e723"
name="xd21e723src">50</a> which was once very near the Earth World, was
raised to its present position. The cannibalistic and voracious
appetite of Manah&aacute;ut was causing the slow extermination of the
human race,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e729src" href="#xd21e729" name=
"xd21e729src">51</a> and the aid of the gods was invoked. The Ifugaos
have a number of powerful deities who always remain in a sitting
posture. One of these suddenly rose up, and, with his head and
shoulders, thrust the sky region of Manah&aacute;ut to a vast height
above the earth, thereby preventing the extermination of the
people.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e732src" href="#xd21e732" name=

<p>As a final example of Ki&aacute;n&#864;gan Ifugao mythology, I give

<p class="first">The wife of the god Hinumb&iacute;an is Dak&aacute;ue.
She has no children except a daughter called B&uacute;gan. This
B&uacute;gan was with her parents in Lukt&aacute;g. Let it be noted
that these divinities of the highest region of the Sky World do not see
directly that which takes place in the lower spheres, but the first
calls the second, and the second the third, etc. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=

god, known as Bun&#864;g&oacute;n&#864;gol, charges or gives orders to
his son Amp&uacute;al, who in turn orders his son Balitt&iacute;on, and
the latter orders and charges L&iacute;ddum of the lowest sky region,
or Kab&uacute;nian. This L&iacute;ddum is the one that communicates
directly with the Ifugaos. The said B&uacute;gan, daughter of
Hinumb&iacute;an, was at that time a maiden, while in Lukt&aacute;g,
and her uncle Baiyuh&iacute;bi<a class="noteref" id="xd21e752src" href=
"#xd21e752" name="xd21e752src">54</a> told her to go down and amuse
herself in the third sky region, Hubul&aacute;n. So, according to the
wishes of her relatives, she went down to Hubul&aacute;n where
Dologd&oacute;gan, the brother of Balitt&iacute;on, was. The said
Dologd&oacute;gan had gone to Hubul&aacute;n to marry another
B&uacute;gan. The first B&uacute;gan, daughter of Hinumb&iacute;an, had
been advised to marry in Lukt&aacute;g, but she did not wish to do so,
and so they told her to go off and divert herself in Hubul&aacute;n.
Having settled down in this sky region, her uncles advised her to get
married there, but neither did she wish this. In view of her attitude
on this question, Dologd&oacute;gan exhorted her to descend to
Kab&uacute;nian, and go to take her abode in the house of L&iacute;ddum
her relative and the son of Amgal&iacute;n&#864;gan. The said
L&iacute;ddum wished her to marry in Kab&uacute;nian, but she also
refused to do this. Near the house, or town, of L&iacute;ddum (whose
wife is called Lin&#864;gan) there was a village called
Habi&aacute;tan, and the lord of the village also bore this name. Such
being the case, the said Habi&aacute;tan went to the house of
L&iacute;ddum, and, upon seeing the young B&uacute;gan in the condition
of maidenhood, he asked L&iacute;ddum: &ldquo;Why does this maid not
marry?&rdquo; The former answered him: &ldquo;We have counseled her to
it, but she does not wish to do so. I, upon seeing that she did not
wish to get married, nor to follow my advice, said to her: &lsquo;Why
dost thou not get married?&rsquo; She began to laugh. I replied:
&lsquo;Then, if thou dost not wish to get married in Kab&uacute;nian,
it were better for thee to return to thy people and thy family of
Lukt&aacute;g,&rsquo; but she answered: &lsquo;That is not necessary,
and I should like to stay with thee in thy house&mdash;and I shall take
care to get married at my pleasure, when I see or meet someone of my
liking, and then I shall tell thee.&rsquo;&rdquo; Habi&aacute;tan,
after hearing this story of L&iacute;ddum, said to him:
&ldquo;According to this, I shall take the young B&uacute;gan to my
<i>rancheria</i> and house in Habi&aacute;tan to see if she wishes to
marry my son Bag&iacute;lat.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e758src"
href="#xd21e758" name="xd21e758src">55</a> To which L&iacute;ddum
rejoined: &ldquo;If B&uacute;gan so desire, it goes without saying that
she can accompany thee at once.&rdquo; The maiden having been
consulted, assented, and went off with Habi&aacute;tan to his house and
village. Having arrived at the said place, and after B&uacute;gan had
observed somewhat the young Bag&iacute;lat, as if Habi&aacute;tan had
asked her whether she desired to marry him, she answered: &ldquo;How am
I to wish to marry him (Bag&iacute;lat), grim and fierce as he is, and
making use of such an extraordinary spear! Moreover, he never
stops&mdash;but is always running around in all parts of the Sky World,
through the north and the south, through the east and the west;&rdquo;
and she told Habi&aacute;tan that she did not wish to marry his son
Bag&iacute;lat, the Lightning, because that through his effects he
harmed plants, fruits, and possibly might injure even herself. Then
said Habi&aacute;tan: &ldquo;Thou art somewhat fastidious, and I see
that thou couldst with great difficulty get married in these regions;
it would be better that thou return once more to thy land.&rdquo; She
answered that she did not desire to return any more to her people, and
that accordingly she would betake <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107"
href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>herself to some other point
more to her liking. This dialogue being completed, she went down from
the house of Habi&aacute;tan, and, casting a glance at the four
cardinal points, she saw that the weather was clear and calm, and
descried on the Earth a place called Pan&#864;gag&aacute;uan, over (or
on) Umbuk, where there was an Ifugao called
Kin&#864;gg&aacute;uan&mdash;a young man, unmarried, naked, and without
a clout (which he had thrown away because of its age), because he was
engaged in making pits, or wells, for catching deer with a trap
(according to the custom)&mdash;and there he had a hut. Upon seeing him
B&uacute;gan exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh! the poor man! and how
unfortunate!&rdquo; And, hiding the occurrence from Habi&aacute;tan,
she determined to return to her sky region of Lukt&aacute;g in order to
manifest to her father, Hinumb&iacute;an, that it was her desire to
descend to the Earth World in order to get married with that poor
Ifugao.</p>
<p>The paternal permission having been obtained, she made ready the
necessary provisions&mdash;consisting of a vessel of cooked rice and a
clout (or <i>bah&aacute;g</i>). In this fashion she proceeded to
Kin&#864;gg&aacute;uan&rsquo;s hut and entered it, saying: &ldquo;Who
is the owner of this hut?&rdquo; &ldquo;I,&rdquo; answered
Kin&#864;gg&aacute;uan, &ldquo;but I am ashamed to approach thee,
because thou art a woman and I am naked.&rdquo; To which she replied:
&ldquo;Never mind! because here I have a clout for thee.&rdquo; But he
did not approach for shame; and so she threw him the clout from afar,
in order that he might cover himself. The surprised man expressed to
her his astonishment, saying: &ldquo;Why dost thou approach here,
knowing that the appearance of a woman, when men are engaged in such an
occupation, is of evil omen for the hunt?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e768src" href="#xd21e768" name="xd21e768src">56</a> And she
replied to him: &ldquo;By no means shall it come to pass as thou
thinkest, but, on the contrary, thou shalt be extremely lucky in it.
For the present let us eat together, and let us sleep this night in thy
hut. To-morrow thou shalt see how lucky we are in the hunt.&rdquo; The
following day, upon going to visit the pits, they actually found them
full. Kin&#864;gg&aacute;uan killed the quarry and spent the rest of
the day in carrying the carcasses to his hut. He kept alive only two
little pigs, a male and a female, which he delivered to B&uacute;gan
that she might tie them in the dwelling-place while he was bringing in
the rest of the dead game. On the second day B&uacute;gan asked the
solitary one: &ldquo;Why dost thou dwell in such evil places?&rdquo;
Kin&#864;gg&aacute;uan answered her: &ldquo;Because my parents are so
parsimonious in giving me what I need.&rdquo; Then said B&uacute;gan to
him: &ldquo;Let us go to Ki&aacute;n&#864;gan,&rdquo; and he consented.
Leaving, then, the dead game in the hut, they carried with them only
the two live &ldquo;piglets.&rdquo; Kin&#864;gg&aacute;uan carried the
male one, and B&uacute;gan the female one&mdash;arriving at the
above-mentioned place on the nightfall of the second day.</p>
<p>Having arrived at Ki&aacute;n&#864;gan, they took up their lodging
in the house of Kin&#864;gg&aacute;uan&rsquo;s mother&mdash;the man
entering first and then B&uacute;gan. The mother of the former was
surprised, and asked him: &ldquo;Who is this woman?&rdquo; The son
answered: &ldquo;I was at the hunting place and she presented herself
to me there and I do not know whence she comes.&rdquo; The aged mother
after having looked at them a little while&mdash;when
seated&mdash;addressed herself to B&uacute;gan and asked: &ldquo;Who
art thou? How dost thou call thyself? From <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>whence dost thou come?&rdquo; The maiden replied
that her name was B&uacute;gan, that she was the daughter of
Hinumb&iacute;an and Dak&aacute;ue, and that she belonged to the sky
region of Lukt&aacute;g. But the reason of her descent to that
terraqueous region, and of accompanying her son, was her having seen
him so poor and deserted * * * &ldquo;for which reason I took pity on
him and came down to visit him and to furnish him with an abundance of
game&rdquo; * * * and she added that on the following day the mother
should send many people to collect the dead game which they had left in
the lonely hut of her son. By a coincidence, the mother of the young
man was also called B&uacute;gan, with the addition of <i>na
kantal&aacute;o</i>.</p>
<p>During all this, the young couple had already been united in the
bond of matrimony&mdash;without any of the prescribed
formalities&mdash;at the place called Pan&#864;gag&aacute;uan, and
B&uacute;gan gave birth to a vigorous son to whom she gave the name
Balit&uacute;k. The little pigs, also, which they had brought, gave
forth their fruit. The child grew a little, but he did not yet know how
to walk. His mother, B&uacute;gan, as a being from the Sky World, did
not eat like the rest of the people of Ki&aacute;n&#864;gan, but
desired only boiled rice, birds, and meat of game. Those of that region
bore her much envy because of her being a stranger; and, because they
knew she did not like certain vegetables of theirs, they strove to make
her depart from their town and to betake herself to her birthplace of
Lukt&aacute;g in the sky. Their envy toward her increased upon their
seeing the abundance of her fowls and pigs. With the object, then, of
disgusting her, and of driving her away, they attempted to surround her
house with certain garden stuffs, greens, and fish. With these they
succeeded effectively in making B&uacute;gan fall sick with an intense
itch and fever; for which reason she abandoned that house and went to
another place, while her husband moved to a rice granary. But they
persecuted her again in her new place of lodging, surrounding it with
the vegetables and other things spoken of above, and causing her nausea
in a stomach accustomed to other food. In view of such wearisome
tricks, B&uacute;gan proposed to Kin&#864;gg&aacute;uan her desire to
return to her land with the new blossom of spring, their child. Her
husband answered her: &ldquo;I should well like to accompany thee, but
I am afraid of ascending to so high a place.&rdquo; &ldquo;There is no
reason to be afraid,&rdquo; replied B&uacute;gan, &ldquo;I myself shall
take thee up in the <i>&aacute;yud</i> (a kind of hammock).&rdquo; She
accordingly strove to persuade him, but Kin&#864;gg&aacute;uan did not
lay aside his fear; then she attempted to take him up bound to a rope,
but neither did she effect this. During these labors, she soared aloft
with the child to the heights of Lukt&aacute;g, but upon perceiving
that her husband had not followed her she went down again, with her son
in the band which the Ifugaos use for that purpose. (<a href=
"#pl-03-2">Plate III, fig. 2.</a>) After conferring with
Kin&#864;gg&aacute;uan, she said to him: &ldquo;Thou seest the
situation. I cannot continue among thy countrymen, because they hate me
unto death. Neither dost thou dare to ascend unto Lukt&aacute;g. What
we can do is to divide our son,&rdquo; * * * and, seizing a knife,
B&uacute;gan divided her son Balit&uacute;k in the middle, or just
above the waist, and made the following division: The head and the rest
of the upper trunk she left to Kin&#864;gg&aacute;uan&mdash;that it
might be easier for him to give a new living being to those upper
parts&mdash;and she retained for herself the lower part of the trunk
unto the feet; and as for the entrails, intestines, heart, liver, and
even the very excrement, she divided <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>them&mdash;leaving
the half for her husband. The partition having been completed,
B&uacute;gan mounted to her heavenly mansion, taking with her the part
of her son which fell to her lot, and, giving it a breath of life, she
converted it into a new celestial being retaining the very name of
Balit&uacute;k. On the other hand, the part which she had left to her
husband, on the earth, began to be corrupted and decayed, because he,
Kin&#864;gg&aacute;uan, had not been able, or did not know how, to
reanimate it. The foul odor of the putrified flesh reached unto the
dwelling place of B&uacute;gan in Lukt&aacute;g, and, having been
perceived by her, she descended to Kab&uacute;nian in order to better
acquaint herself with the happening. From Kab&uacute;nian she saw that
the evil odor issued from the decomposition of the part of the entrails
which she had left on the earth in charge of her husband, and which he
had not reanimated. Then she broke forth in cries of grief, pity, and
compassion&mdash;and, descending to Ki&aacute;n&#864;gan, she severely
accused Kin&#864;gg&aacute;uan, saying unto him: &ldquo;Why hast thou
allowed our son to rot? And why hast thou not quickened him to
life?&rdquo; Upon which he answered that he did not understand the art
of reanimation.</p>
<p>B&uacute;gan endeavored to remove the greatest possible portion of
the corrupted part of her son. Consequently, she changed the head of
Balit&uacute;k into an owl<a class="noteref" id="xd21e792src" href=
"#xd21e792" name="xd21e792src">57</a>&mdash;a nocturnal bird called
<i>ak&uacute;p</i> by the Ifugaos&mdash;whence the origin of the
Ki&aacute;n&#864;gan custom of auguring evil from this bird, and the
offering of sacrifices of fowls to B&uacute;gan, in order that no harm
should come to them, and that the said owl should not return to
them.</p>
<p>The ears she threw into the forest, and for that reason there come
forth on the trees certain growths, like chalk, half spherical (certain
species of fungi). The nose she threw away and changed it also into a
certain species of shell which attaches itself to trees. Of the half of
the excrement she made the bill of a small bird called <i>ido</i>, from
which the Ifugaos augur well or ill, according to certain variations of
its song.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e803src" href="#xd21e803" name=
"xd21e803src">58</a></p>
<p>From the putrified tongue she produced a malady, or swelling, of the
tongue in men, which is cured with a hot egg, or with a chicken, which
they offer to their mother, B&uacute;gan.</p>
<p>From the bones of the breast she created a venomous serpent. From
the heart she made the rainbow. From the fingers she made certain very
long shells, after the form of fingers. From the hair, thrown into the
water, she created certain little worms or maggots. From the skin she
drew forth a bird of red color, called <i>k&uacute;kuk</i>. From the
half of the blood she created the small bats
(<i>lit&aacute;l&icirc;t</i>). From the liver she drew <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>forth a certain disease of the breast. From the
intestines she formed a class of somewhat large animals, resembling
rabbits or rats (<i>am&uacute;n&icirc;n?</i>). From the bones of the
arms she made pieces of dry or rotted wood that fall from trees upon
passers-by who approach them.</p>
<p>The Balit&uacute;k that B&uacute;gan reanimated is in the sky region
of Lukt&aacute;g.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e834src" href="#xd21e834"

<p>The myth just given is an example of one of the most interesting
processes in the early development of literature. It is probable that
originally it was only a simple origin myth, but it has been elaborated
and developed until now it is worthy of its little niche in the

<h3 class="main">Central Ifugao Beliefs</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The exact difference between the Central Ifugao and
the Ki&aacute;n&#864;gan beliefs is not an easy matter to determine.
There has been much mixture between the two peoples accompanied by a
corresponding exchange of ideas. The effect of this exchange in some
cases has been to produce a deceptive similarity in beliefs and myths
that originally were fundamentally different; while in other cases
myths that were originally the same have been so greatly differentiated
in the two areas that their unity can scarcely be recognized.</p>
<p>However, it would seem that some basic differences really exist, and
the probability is that they are survivals from the ancient cultures of
the peoples who went to make up the present distinctly composite Ifugao
group. But the evidence at hand is not sufficient to warrant a full
discussion of this question here, and I shall merely cite one example.
Ki&aacute;n&#864;gan myths are nearly always told from the standpoint
of the gods, and have to do with the dealings of the gods with one
another and with men. On the other hand, Central Ifugao myths are told
from the standpoint of men in their relations and dealings with the
gods. This will be made plain by a comparison of the following Central
Ifugao myth with the Origin of the Ifugaos previously given.</p>

<p class="first"><i>The Golden Age.</i>&mdash;Ifugao knowledge of the
prediluvian period is very vague. It is known, however, that the Earth
World was entirely flat except for two great mountains, one in the east
called Am&uacute;yao and one in the west called
Kalau&iacute;tan.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e865src" href="#xd21e865"

central plain between the two great mountains.</p>
<p>The period was something like a Golden Age, when things were much
better than they are now. The people were demigods whose life was a
happy one and their country a sort of Garden of Eden. To obtain rice,
all that they needed to do was to cut down a stalk of bamboo, which was
plentiful, and split open the joints which were filled with hulled rice
ready to cook. Stalks of sugar-cane were filled with
<i>baiyax</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e882src" href="#xd21e882"
name="xd21e882src">62</a> and needed only to be tapped to furnish a
most refreshing drink. The river was full of fish, and the forests were
filled with deer and wild hogs <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112"
href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span>which were much easier to
catch than those of the present day. The rice grains of that time were
larger and more satisfying, and a handful of them was sufficient to
feed a large family.</p>
<p>But this Golden Age, like others, was not destined to last.</p>

<p class="first"><i>The flood, and the origin of the
mountains.</i>&mdash;One year when the rainy season should have come it
did not. Month after month passed by and no rain fell. The river grew
smaller and smaller day by day until at last it disappeared entirely.
The people began to die, and at last the old men said: &ldquo;If we do
not soon get water, we shall all die. Let us dig down into the grave of
the river, for the river is dead and has sunk into his grave, and
perhaps we may find the soul of the river and it will save us from
dying.&rdquo; So they began to dig, and they dug for three days. On the
third day the hole was very large, and suddenly they struck a great
spring and the water gushed forth. It came so fast that some of them
were drowned before they could get out of the pit.</p>
<p>Then the people were happy, for there was plenty of water; and they
brought much food and made a great feast. But while they were feasting
it grew dark and began to rain. The river also kept rising until at
last it overflowed its bank. Then the people became frightened and they
tried to stop up the spring in the river, but they could not do so.
Then the old men said: &ldquo;We must flee to the mountains, for the
river gods are angry and we shall all be drowned.&rdquo; So the people
fled toward the mountains and all but two of them were overtaken by the
water and drowned. The two who escaped were a brother and sister named
W&iacute;gan and B&uacute;gan&mdash;W&iacute;gan on Mt. Am&uacute;yao
and B&uacute;gan on Kalau&iacute;tan. And the water continued to rise
until all the Earth World was covered excepting only the peaks of these
two mountains.</p>
<p>The water remained on the earth for a whole season or from rice
planting to rice harvest.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e903src" href=
"#xd21e903" name="xd21e903src">63</a> During that time W&iacute;gan and
B&uacute;gan lived on fruits and nuts from the forests that covered the
tops of the two mountains. B&uacute;gan had fire which at night lit up
the peak of Kalau&iacute;tan, and W&iacute;gan knew that there was
someone else alive besides himself. He had no fire, and suffered much
from the cold.</p>
<p>At last the waters receded from the earth and left it covered with
the rugged mountains and deep valleys that exist to-day; and the
solitary brother and sister, looking down from their respective peaks,
were filled with wonder at the sight.</p>

<p class="first"><i>The repopulation of the Earth World.</i>&mdash;As
soon as the earth was dry, W&iacute;gan journeyed to Kalau&iacute;tan
where he found his sister B&uacute;gan, and their reunion was most
joyous. They descended the mountain and wandered about until they came
to the beautiful valley that is to-day the dwelling place of the
Ban&aacute;uol clan&mdash;and here W&iacute;gan built a house. When the
house was finished, B&uacute;gan dwelt in the upper part and
W&iacute;gan slept beneath.</p>
<p>Having provided for the comfort of his sister, W&iacute;gan started
out to find if there were not other people left alive in the Earth
World. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>traveled about all the day and returned to the
house at night to sleep. He did this for three days, and then as he was
coming back on the third evening he said to himself that there were no
other people in the world but themselves, and if the world was to be
repopulated it must be through them. * * * At last B&uacute;gan
realized that she was pregnant. She burst into violent weeping, and,
heaping reproaches on his head, ran blindly away toward the East,
following the course of the river. After traveling a long way, and
being overcome with grief and fatigue, B&uacute;gan sank down upon the
bank of the river and lay there trembling and sobbing.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e919src" href="#xd21e919" name="xd21e919src">64</a>
After having quieted herself somewhat, she arose and looked around her,
and what was her surprise to see sitting on a rock near her an old man
with a long white beard! He approached her and said: &ldquo;Do not be
afraid, daughter! I am Makn&oacute;n&#864;gan, and I am aware of your
trouble, and I have come to tell you that it is all right!&rdquo; While
he was speaking, W&iacute;gan, who had followed his sister, appeared on
the scene. Then Makn&oacute;n&#864;gan placed the sanction and blessing
of the gods upon their marriage, assuring them that they had done
right, and that through them the world must be repeopled. He told them
to return to their house, and whenever they were in trouble to offer
sacrifices to the gods. After B&uacute;gan had become convinced in this
manner, they left Makn&oacute;n&#864;gan and returned home.</p>
<p>In the course of time nine children were born to W&iacute;gan and
B&uacute;gan, five sons and four daughters. The four oldest sons
married the four daughters, and from them are descended all of the
people of the Earth World. The youngest son, who was named Igon, had no
wife.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e924src" href="#xd21e924" name=

<p class="first"><i>The sacrifice of Igon.</i>&mdash;One year the crops
failed, there was much sickness, and everything went wrong. Then
W&iacute;gan remembered the advice of Makn&oacute;n&#864;gan, and he
told his sons to procure an animal for the sacrifice. They caught a rat
and sacrificed it, but the evil conditions were not remedied. Then they
went out into the forest and captured a large snake and sacrificed it
to the gods, but the disease and crop failure still continued. Then
W&iacute;gan said: &ldquo;The sacrifice is not great enough, for the
gods do not hear! Take your brother Igon, who has no wife, and
sacrifice him!&rdquo; So they bound Igon, and sacrificed him, and
called upon the gods. And Makn&oacute;n&#864;gan came, and all the
other great gods, to the feast. And they took away the sickness, and
filled the granaries with rice, and increased the chickens, the pigs,
and the children. Then Makn&oacute;n&#864;gan said to the people:
&ldquo;It is well, but you have committed an evil in spilling human
blood and have thereby brought war and fighting into the world. Now you
must separate to the north, south, east, and west, and not live
together any more. And when ye have need to sacrifice to the gods, do
not offer rats, snakes, or your children, but take pigs and chickens
only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And one of the sons of W&iacute;gan went to the north, and one to
the south, and one to the east, and one to the west; and from them are
descended the peoples of the Earth World, who fight and kill one
another to this day because of the sacrifice of Igon.</p>

<p>Many other illustrations might be given of the differences between
the Central and Ki&aacute;n&#864;gan Ifugao religious conceptions, but

<p>One more type of Ifugao origin myth merits our attention before we
come to the conclusion. This type consists of the myths invented to
explain the origin of the ancient Chinese jars, bronze gongs,
amber-agate beads, and other rare articles of foreign manufacture on
which the Ifugaos place a high value, and the origin of which they do
not know. Many of these objects have been in the possession of the
people for at least several hundred years. They were probably brought
into the Islands by Chinese traders centuries before the coming of the
Spaniards, and gradually found their way to the Ifugaos through the
medium of their cursory commerce with the surrounding peoples.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e951src" href="#xd21e951" name=

<p>One of these myths, explaining the origin of three well-known jars,
runs as follows.</p>

<h2 class="main">Legend Concerning Ban&#864;gg&iacute;l&icirc;t of

of Souls<a class="noteref" id="xd21e962src" href="#xd21e962" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A long time ago, before the coming of the Spaniards,
there lived at Hinag&aacute;n&#864;gan a man called
Ban&#864;gg&iacute;l&icirc;t. He was a wealthy man, possessing four
rice granaries and a <i>very</i> large house; but he was not a priest.
His constant desire was to hunt in the forest.</p>
<p>One day Ban&#864;gg&iacute;l&icirc;t went hunting in the forest and
was overtaken by night. He called his dogs but they did not come. He
made fire, cooked, and ate. Then one dog came to him, and he took it in
lead and departed. Near by he found a path. The dog with him barked and
the second dog answered, and they went on. And the dog with
Ban&#864;gg&iacute;l&icirc;t began to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb115" href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>whimper and whine,
and to pull on the leash; and Ban&#864;gg&iacute;l&icirc;t ran, and
they went on. Suddenly it became light all around them, and they came
out of the forest into a large group of people. And the people said
among themselves: &ldquo;Surely Ban&#864;gg&iacute;l&icirc;t is
dead,&rdquo; and they examined his body and asked: &ldquo;Where were
you speared?&rdquo; And Ban&#864;gg&iacute;l&icirc;t spoke and said:
&ldquo;I have not been speared! I went hunting and was overtaken by
night, and my dog here ran ahead on our path. I followed, and came
here, and lo! it is light here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they took Ban&#864;gg&iacute;l&icirc;t and went to their
town&mdash;for there are many large towns there in the dwelling-place
of souls. They wished to give him food, but he said: &ldquo;Wait until
my own food is exhausted, and then I will eat of your rice here.&rdquo;
And they asked him: &ldquo;How many days will you remain with
us?&rdquo; and Ban&#864;gg&iacute;l&icirc;t answered that he would
remain four days. Then the people began to laugh and one of them said:
&ldquo;Not four days but four <i>years</i> here!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; cried Ban&#864;gg&iacute;l&icirc;t, &ldquo;I shall
never do that! Wait until you see!&rdquo; &ldquo;Just so!&rdquo;
answered the other, &ldquo;but one day here is the same as a year on
the Earth World,&rdquo; but Ban&#864;gg&iacute;l&icirc;t thought that
he was lying.</p>
<p>Ban&#864;gg&iacute;l&icirc;t visited all of the towns there. He
worked in the rice fields and they gave him four jars as his wages.
Then his host said to him: &ldquo;Return home now, for you have been
here four days, which, according to the usage of the Earth World, are
four years.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered
Ban&#864;gg&iacute;l&icirc;t, &ldquo;I wish to go home now, as I am
homesick for my family. You have been very good to me, for you have
given me wages for my work.&rdquo; And the host said: &ldquo;It was a
gift; not wages, but a gift, that I gave you,&rdquo; and he led the way
and pointed out to Ban&#864;gg&iacute;l&icirc;t a ladder. &ldquo;Go
down that ladder, and in a short time you will arrive at your
house,&rdquo; he said.<a id="xd21e983" name="xd21e983"></a>
Ban&#864;gg&iacute;l&icirc;t started to go down, but one of the jars
struck heavily against the ladder and was broken. He went down the
ladder and at last arrived in the top of a betel-nut tree. He slid down
the trunk of the tree to the ground, and the chickens were crowing and
it was just dawn. And he looked at his surroundings and exclaimed:
&ldquo;Why this is my own house!&rdquo; His relatives came out and
said: &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; and he replied: &ldquo;This is my
house.&rdquo; They looked at him closely and cried: &ldquo;Well now, it
is Ban&#864;gg&iacute;l&icirc;t who has been gone these four
years!&rdquo; And they sat down and talked long together. He showed
them the jars, and they asked: &ldquo;Where did you get those?&rdquo;
And he answered: &ldquo;I brought them from the Sky World,&rdquo; and
they were afraid and went to look for the ladder but it was no longer
there.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e985src" href="#xd21e985" name=

mountains into Lepanto or Benguet and returned after four years with

current among the Ifugaos.</p>

about 127,000 Ifugaos, nearly all living in the subprovince of Ifugao.
They are divided into a large number of hereditary clans, each of which
has its own social and political organization. They are an agricultural
people, and have developed their great stone-faced terraced rice fields
to an extent probably not equaled elsewhere in the world. I do not
believe that the physical type, language, or culture of these people is
wholly a native development. The evidence seems to indicate that the
present-day Ifugaos are the result of mixture, perhaps one or more
thousand years ago, of several widely different native types with an
incoming people of high culture. Indications seem to point to the
highlands of Burma as the original home of this highly-cultured people,
but this is a supposition that will require proof. Within historic
times the Ifugaos have been almost entirely free from mixture of any
sort.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd21e499src">&uarr;</a></p>

the blue-stone underfacing of Kab&uacute;nian immediately above cut off

hundreds. Of the very diverse and all-inclusive character of these
deities, no accurate idea can be given within the brief limits of this
paper. Suffice it to say there are gods of war, of industry (such as
weaving, metal-working, etc.), and of beauty and love; nature-gods,
cannibalistic gods, evil deities, mythical monsters, messenger spirits,

cave would be an inconvenience of the same character as that which is
here ascribed to the sky.</p>
<p class="footnote">A further proof of this is the following
Tag&aacute;log myth furnished me by Mr. Roberto Laperal: &ldquo;In
former times the sky was very low and could be touched with the hand;
when men were playing, they would strike their heads against it
whenever they jumped upward. This made them impatient, and one day they
began to throw stones at the sky. The great god Bathala was very angry

<i>&Iacute;do</i>, or <i>&iacute;du</i>, is the Ifugao name for the
omen spirits. A certain small black and white bird called
<i>p&icirc;tp&icirc;t</i> is believed to be an omen spirit, and
therefore it is also properly called <i>&iacute;do</i>. When an Ifugao
is going on a journey and sees one of these birds, or hears its cry, he
immediately stops and calls out to it. He tells it where he is going
and why. If the bird flies away to one side or in a forward direction,
it is a good sign; but if it flies backward along the path, uttering a
sharp cry of fright, it is a very bad omen, and the man will probably
return home and not continue on his journey until another
day.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd21e803src">&uarr;</a></p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e834" href="#xd21e834src" name="xd21e834">59</a></span> I am
informed by Dr. Dean S. Fansler that he obtained from an Igorot of
T&uacute;blai, Benguet, in May, 1910, a myth very similar to this story
of B&uacute;gan and Kin&#864;gg&aacute;uan. The details are different,
but some of the more important incidents are the same and I will give a
brief summary of the myth here: A god named Dum&aacute;gid, whose home
is in one of the lower regions of the sky, came down to the earth and
lived among the people. He taught the people many things, and often
went hunting with them in the forest. But one day, when he was out in
the woods alone, he met a beautiful girl by the name of D&uacute;gai
with whom he fell in love, and they were married. A son was born to
them, and they named him Ovug. Shortly after this Dum&aacute;gid
informed the people that he must return to the Sky World to make report
to the chief deity, Kabigat, but that he would soon come down again to
the Earth World. But the people demanded that he take his wife with
him, and that they leave their son as security for their return.
Dum&aacute;gid told D&uacute;gai that the path was so hot that she
might die, but this the people would not believe. So Dum&aacute;gid and
D&uacute;gai started out, but as they approached the sun it grew so hot
that D&uacute;gai died. Dum&aacute;gid returned her body to the earth,
and went on to his home in the sky. Later he came back to the earth, in
company with the god Ban&#864;gan di Bai-&aacute;n&#864;gan, and told
the people that he must take his son Ovug to the Sky World. This the
people refused to allow him to do, so Dum&aacute;gid took a knife and
divided his son Ovug into equal parts by cutting him straight down.
When he had done this, he told the people to keep one half and make a
new boy out of it. The other half Dum&aacute;gid took with him to the
Sky World and reanimated it. Then he looked down to the Earth World and
saw that the half of his son there was becoming decayed because the
people had not given it new life. So he came down with the boy he had
made, and made another beautiful boy out of the decayed half. Then he
made the two boys stand before the astonished people. For their greater
astonishment, Dum&aacute;gid asked the boy he had made in the Sky World
to talk. He spoke very loud like sharp thunder, so that the people were
frightened almost to death. Then Dum&aacute;gid asked the other boy to
talk, and he spoke low like the rolling thunder. Then the first boy
went up to the Sky World whirling like fire, and thundered there. And
it is believed that this is the origin of the lightning and the sharp
thunder that comes after; and it is also believed that the low thunder
is the voice of the second boy, or the one made on the
earth.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd21e834src">&uarr;</a></p>

frequent repetition of B&uacute;gan as the name of a female deity is
worthy of further explanation. B&uacute;gan is the Ifugao ideal of
feminine beauty. There is no single goddess of love and beauty such as
Venus or Aphrodite, but an abstract ideal of womanly perfection.
Therefore, all beneficent female deities are called B&uacute;gan, which
is also the most common name among Ifugao women. When a man wishes to
praise his wife, he speaks of her as <i>B&uacute;gan-ko</i> (my
B&uacute;gan), and when a young man goes courting he often speaks of it
as <i>mum-B&uacute;gan</i> (searching for a B&uacute;gan). Light,
fleecy clouds, high in the sky, are often called &ldquo;the wavy hair
of B&uacute;gan.&rdquo; Such poetic usages are almost innumerable. It
is an interesting conception, and is one of the proofs of Ifugao
&aelig;sthetic development.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=
